No service can eliminate all hidden tracking or online profiling, as trackers are always trying to evade specific protections. To be effective, our protections are continually evolving to mitigate this while also preventing sites from becoming inoperable. This is also why we offer several types of protections against web tracking. Other browsers offer some of these protections by default, such as cookie and fingerprinting protections, but we also offer many other protections that most browsers don't offer by default, such as 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection, Global Privacy Control, Link Tracking Protection, CNAME Cloaking Protection, Google AMP Protection, and more, which help cover different types of tracking. Our list of trackers is open source, as is the list of exceptions we've compiled to preserve usability. Learn more."

On other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled from personal information, such as your search, browsing, and purchase history. We don’t have this information (per our <span class='text-indigo-500'>Privacy Policy</span>) because search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you’re looking at, not what other companies’ tracking algorithms assume about you. For example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars.

Or ads that keep following you around with something you once searched for? Whose responsibility is that? Probably Google. Google has been tracking your searches for decades by embedding trackers in its Chrome browser and hiding even more trackers on its most popular websites. In contrast, our browser lets you search and browse as usual, but (unlike Google) we never track you. In addition, our browser helps block trackers from Google and other companies that operate other online tracking networks, such as TikTok and Meta (Facebook).<br/><span class='font-bold'>Use DuckDuckGo to enjoy a better online experience.</span> Have you noticed that Google’s search results are getting worse? A lot of people have. For many Google searches, the majority of results on the first page are either ads or Google promoting its own services. On mobile devices, it can be even worse. At DuckDuckGo, we keep ads to a minimum and our search ads are private, based only on the search results page you’re viewing, not on you as a person. By default, our browser’s built-in tracker blocking also blocks many ads that rely on trackers from loading. Along with other browser features like automatic cookie pop-up blocking, our default web tracking protections provide an overall cleaner online experience with DuckDuckGo.<br/><span class='font-bold'>Use DuckDuckGo to send a message to Big Tech.</span> Use DuckDuckGo because it's fast and secure, because it's a free alternative to Google that lets you search and browse the way you want, and because it puts you back in control of your personal data."

Incognito mode doesn't stop Google from saving your searches, nor does it stop companies, internet service providers, or governments from tracking you online. On the other hand, DuckDuckGo Search never keeps your search history or anyone else's, and the DuckDuckGo browser also helps keep websites private. <span class='text-indigo-500'>Learn more</span>"
